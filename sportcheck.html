				<h1>Sport Check - Sports News Channel</h1>
				<p>After creating the designs for the Watford 23/24 season home kits, I felt that I should try my hand at a much larger project. Being a huge sports fan in general and not just football (contrary to popular belief), it seemed right to try to create my own sports news channel that can be customised with incoming information and most aspects animated.</p>

			  	<h3>Channel Name</h3>
			  	<p>After a long process of trying to come up with catchy names for this sports news channel, I eventually ended up with 'SportCheck'.</p>
				<p>This is because I am guilty of checking my phone at bad times to ensure I'm constantly aware of updates in the sport world. Needing to do this quickly, it's fitting to have the channel name sound similar to "spot check".</p><br>

				<h3>Channel Logo</h3>
				<p>Coming up with a name was, to me, the hardest part of the process as I already had some ideas for how I wanted to channel logo to look. It had to be simple, bold, eye-catching and portray what the channel is about.</p>

			<p>The final logo.</p>
			<p> The reason for this design is because the 'O' looks as if it is crossing the line made by the 'H' in 'CHECK'. This is a similar visual to the ball crossing the goal line in football, which would have to be checked by the match officials. </p>

				<h3>Channel Colour Scheme</h3>
				<p>Once the name and logo of the channel had been decided, I needed to find a suitable colour scheme that would catch the viewers attention in advertising but would be suitable for people to look at for longer periods of time on their devices.</p>
			  <p>One of the most striking, powerful and bold colours is black [#000000] so that would be one of the base colours, perhaps for any type as it is easily legible on top of most other colours.</p>
				<p>The other colours had to be bright and vibrant to stand out to people in advertising but a different colour had to be used in the elements that are going to be looked at for long periods of time. This is because the brighter colours could cause viewers eyes to feel strained. </p>

				<h3>Channel Typefaces</h3>
				<p>The typefaces used needed to be easily legible more than anything. This is because it conveys information about the sports world to viewers. It was for the same reason that I decided it needed to be a sans-serif typeface.</p>
				<p>The first typeface used is ITC Avant Garde Gothic LT Bold, which would be used for headlines and titles. It made sense to use this typefaces as it mirrors the one used in the Sport Check logo. When put into italics it uses an 11 degree angle.</p>

			<p class="smalltext">For as long as I can remember, rival fans and even some Watford fans have asked the age-old question: "Why is there a moose on the Watford Badge, even though they/we are referred to as 'The Hornets'?".<br><br>
'The Hornets' comes from the colour of Watford's home kit, whichÂ regularly feature black and yellow, but the so-called 'moose' on the badge is meant to be a Hart, a male deer which are commonly found in the Hertfordshire area and feature on the Watford coat of arms. I've wanted to change this in some way or another but never been sure how to until a few weeks ago (written on 5th June 2022).<br><br>
I wanted to redesign the Hart so that it was more obvious that it was a Hart and not a Moose as many people think it is.</p>
